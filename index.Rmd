### Bio

I am a conservation biologist and data scientist interested in utilizing spatial data and modeling techniques to understand dynamic ecosystems in the face of climate change. I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Ecology and Evolution from UC Santa Barbara in 2019, where I conducted research focused on mammalian spatial ecology and the role of bivalves in Costa Rican mariculture systems. 

Following these projects, I served as a field technician studying endangered flat-tailed horned lizards and steelhead trout in Southern California, as well as invasive species in Hawaii. These immersive field roles inspired me to recognize broad ecological patterns across scientific disciplines, leading me to earn a Master’s degree in Environmental Data Science from UC Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science and Management in 2022. 

I apply open-source programming tools and statistics as a data scientist for the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, where I am proud to collaborate with passionate scientists from diverse backgrounds. I served as a member of the Ocean Health Index team, where I studied the relationship between marine health and human livelihoods on a global scale. I currently works at the Arctic Data Center, where I process satellite imagery to provide tools for researchers to answer diverse environmental questions about the arctic region through machine learning.
