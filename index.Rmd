### Bio

I am a conservation biologist and data scientist interested in utilizing modeling techniques and spatial data to understand dynamic ecosystems, wildlife populations, and human livelihoods. With open source programming tools and a collaborative approach, I hope to improve our understanding of anthropogenic influences across the world.

I earned a Master’s degree in Environmental Data Science from UC Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. Prior to the Bren School, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Ecology and Evolution with distinction in the major from UC Santa Barbara in 2019.

My undergraduate research investigated mammalian spatial ecology and the role of bivalves in Costa Rican mariculture systems. Following this, I served as a field technician studying endangered populations of flat-tailed horned lizards and steelhead trout in Southern California, as well as invasive species in Hawaii. These field roles inspired me to delve into environmental data science in order to recognize broad ecological patterns across diverse scientific disciplines.

### Arctic Data & Marine Science

I work at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis. I served as a member of the Arctic Data Center team, and I currently serve as a Data Analyst Fellow at the Ocean Health Index where I contribute to our understanding of marine health on a global scale.
