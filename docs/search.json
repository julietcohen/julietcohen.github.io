      "contents": "\n\nSteelhead trout habitat in Upper Matilija\nCreek in Ojai, CA.\n\nOverlooking Olomana (“three peaks”) on\nthe east side of Oahu, Hawaii during a field survey for incipient\ninvasive species.\nMy path to become a data scientist began as a raccoon trapper, a\nlizard hunter, an island invasive species specialist, and a fisheries\ntechnician. I started collecting data while traversing mountaintops and\nsnorkeling inside aquaculture nets, I learned to clean data and enter it\ninto databases in ArcGIS, and today my passion lies in gleaning\nmeaningful observations from ecological and environmental data. I\nconnected with R, Python, and open data science practices slowly over\ntime. However, I didn’t make this journey alone; I found mentors in\nacademic advisers, field crew leaders, and data scientists that provided\nthe tools to help me grow.\n\nMy coworker at the Oahu Invasive Species\nCommittee laughing as the field crew makes our way down a ridgeline\nafter a hard day’s work bushwacking through the dense uluhe plants that\ncover the lower elevation ridges in the Ko’olau Mountains.\nUndergraduate\nResearch at UC Santa Barbara\nI earned a B.S. in Ecology and Evolution from UC Santa Barbara, and\nduring this time I served as a research technician in Dr. Doug McCauley’s\nlab in the department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine\nBiology. I worked closely with PhD candidate Molly Hardesty-Moore\non her research investigating raccoon spatial ecology in urban\nlandscapes. We trapped raccoons around Santa Barbara county and fitted\nthem with radio collars, then tracked them using VHF telemetry\ntechniques. Molly used this spatial data in conjunction with hair\nsamples from raccoons, foxes, skunks, and opossums to compare behavior\nand dietary trends in raccoons that live in urban versus rural habitats.\nWhile the study was primarily interested in luring raccoons into traps\novernight, we often caught other small carnivores and watched them\nperuse the landscape via camera traps throughout Santa Barbara\nCounty.\nSome of my proudest camera trap photos included black bears and\nbobcats at Sedgwick Reserve:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI completed two independent research projects in undergrad: one\ninvestigating spatial and temporal niche overlap among urban mammals,\nand one looking at water filtration rates among different bivalve\nspecies in Costa Rican mariculture systems. The latter turned into my\nfirst scientific paper, and I had the chance to present my research at a\nbiological research symposium in Monteverde, Costa Rica in 2018. (Check\nout these projects under the Research tab.)\n\nMeasuring the water displacement of\nindividual bivalves at the end of a field day with my colleague Erin,\nwho was relaxing on the boat after a day of snorkeling and data\ncollection for her own research.\n\nleft:\nMeasuring the turbidity of my various species-specific buckets at\nregular time intervals. I would dive into the mariculture nets each day\nto collect new bivalve species, run my secchi disk filtration trials\nwith algae and bryozoans in the buckets, then return the bivalves to\ntheir natural habitat at the end of the day.\nRight:\nOne of my bivlavle filtration trials a the off-shore mariculture site.\nThe different species of bilvalves in each filtered the algae and\nbryozoans at different rates, resulting in different levels of\nturbidity.\n\nAn arboreal snake spotted on a night walk\nthrough the tropical rainforest in Monteverde, Costa Rica\n\nA highly venemous eyelash palm pit viper\nin the tropical rainforest of Costa Rica\nThe Lizard Days\nMy first job post graduation was a seasonal field technician position\nsurveying for flat tailed-horned lizards in desert habitat just inland\nof San Diego and El Centro in Southern California. I committed to a\nthree month season working with a small crew composed of three other\nfield technicians for the Herpetology Department at the San Diego\nNatural History Museum. We surveyed through the desert Monday through\nFriday, often working 50-hour weeks. My weekends were often filled with\nindulging in the luxuries of civilization such as washing machines. I\ndidn’t miss the creosote bushes that surrounded me all week long.\n\nThe first flat-tailed horned lizard we\nspotted during day 1 of survey season\n\nThis iguana has a unique strategy to\navoid the hot desert floor.\nOur team’s mission was to survey for flat-tailed horned lizards to\ndetermine their range throughout the arid landscape. This survey could\nprove that this land was critical habitat for a threatened species and\nprevent mining in the region. We did find plenty of armored lizards,\nside winders, nighthawk nests, mammal skulls, beetles that play dead,\nkangaroo rat tracks, and badger tunnels. The sunrises and sunsets really\nenhance the beauty of the desert landscape, and I wouldn’t trade those\nfield days for anything. I still think about the flat-tailed horned\nlizards fairly often.\n\nThe flat-tiled horned lizard crew\nadmiring the first flat-tailed horned lized spotted that season sunning\nnext to a creosote bush.\nInvasive Species in Hawaii\nMy second seasonal field job was a field technician and data\nspecialist position at the Oahu\nInvasive Species Committee. I moved to Kaneohe on Oahu and, and the\nwork included surveying for incipient invasive plant and insect species\nin the lush forests of the Ko’olau mountains on the east side of the\nisland of Oahu. I quickly fell in love with the extreme ridgelines,\ndespite the discomfort of traversing perilous mountain ranges while\nbushwhacking through impossible tangles of thick strawberry guava tree\ngroves and thorny lantana.\n\nDeep in a humid, mosquito-filled gulch, I\nspotted a juvenile Miconia calvescens plant and plucked it with\nenthusiasm.\nWe also surveyed for plant species in the high elevation forests and\nin select regions of the other mountain range of the Wai’anae\nmountains.\n\nAdmiring the views from the Wai’anae\nMountains as we surveyed for the invasive plant species Chromolaeana\nodorata.\n\nLeft:\nAn aerial survey for Miconia calvescens in the Ko’olau Mountains with my\ncoworker Nick at the Oahu Invasive Species Committee.\nRight:\nAscending a side of a mountian ridge in high-elevation native forest in\nthe Ko’olau Mountains, surveying for native o’hia trees infected with an\ninvasive fungal pathogen called Rapid O’hia Death.\nMy coworkers were at the root of my fondness towards my experience\nworking at the Oahu Invasive Species Committee. My field crew taught me\nabout the native flora and fauna, the history of the island’s people and\ngeology, and how Hawaiian ecology is currently changing. We endured\nendless days bushwhacking and being eaten alive by mosquitos. We bonded\nby helping untangle each other from invasive plant masses, struggling to\nget ArcGIS to cooperate after a long day in the rain, and screaming in\nfear when Kahekili and Josh, our helicopter pilots, took dive bombs on\naerial surveys just to see how close they could scrape along the top of\nthe albezia trees. The field crew usually smelled sweaty, argued about\npolitics on our radios while on survey, and never missed an opportunity\nto chase each other around the baseyard with invasive Jackson’s\nchameleons we confiscated from the field. I miss the OISC crew more than\nany other part of my time in Hawaii.\n\n\nLeft:\nMy coworkers Phill and Kepano and I discussing the day’s survey plan in\nthe middle of native uluhe on a ridge on the east side of the\nisland.\nRight:\nTwo invasive Jackson’s chameleons we found on survey in low-elevation\nforest. We confiscated them from the field because they eat the native\nHawaiian snails.\nSouthern California\nSteelhead Trout\nI served as a fisheries technician for the Pacific States Marine\nFisheries Commission and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife\nto survey for the endangered Southern California steelhead trout and\ntheir resident counterparts, the rainbow trout. We collected data on\ntheir size, mating behavior, and stream conditions. We conducted redd\nsurveys, taking data on trout nests in the gravel bottoms of shallow\nstreams. We electric-fished certain streams to get a comprehensive\nestimate of their population size and PIT tag big fish to track their\nupstream migration during breeding season in December - April, and their\nreturn to the Pacific Ocean around April-May.\n\nLeft:\nA redd survey in Gobernador Creek in Carpinteria, CA.\nRight:\nA 20-inch trout spotted on a snorkel survey in Ventura, CA. Movement\npatterns indicated by a pit tag as well as genetic analysis will reveal\nif this individual is migratory, as is suggested by its markings and\nsize.\n\nElectric fishing in Topanga Creek with\nthe goal of PIT tagging adult trout. We administer a mild shock into the\nwater with that large backpack pictured here, scoop the stunned fish\ninto buckets of oxygenated water, medicate the fish, insert a PIT tag,\nand release them back into the creek when they have fully\nrecovered.\nLeft:\nMeasuring a small trout we caught while electric fishing before\nreturning it to the creek.\nRight:\nWe often found two-striped garter snakes on survey in riparian habitat.\nThis snake species eats fish like chub and trout, so they hang out in\nrocky pools.\nWe used DIDSON\nunderwater sonar camera technology to film our freshwater streams\n24/7 to capture possible steelhead migrations. We deployed cameras in\nthe Ventura River, Salispuedes Creek, and the Santa Ynez River. These\nhigh-tech cameras use sound waves to detect both movement in the water,\nand it was our job to detect trout and other species like turtles and\ncatfish, based on their silhouettes and swimming patterns in the camera\nfootage.\n\nData entry: reviewing sonar footage for\nsteelhead trout, but mainly recording other native fish, chub, debris,\nand the occassional water bird or freshwater turtle.\n\nThe DIDSON crew all geared up to snorkel\naround the Ventura River camera to find the invasive catfish species we\nrepeatedly saw during footage review\n\nA chunky alligator lizard sunning on a\nstone in steelhead trout habitat in Gobernador Creek in Ojai,\nCA\n\nA native western pond turtle spotted on a\nsteelhead trout survey in Gaviota Creek, CA.\n\n\n\n",

Many highly impacted regions\nlack the assets to monitor and generate resource predictions, and\ntherefore lack high-quality environmental and social data. As a result,\nit is difficult to make predictions about the impacts of climate change\nfor these regions using conventional modeling tools. Recently, machine\nlearning approaches applied to high-resolution satellite imagery have\nbeen successful in making predictions of a wide range of social and\nenvironmental variables. However, generating these predictions comes\nwith significant barriers, including high computational costs, data\nstorage and expertise requirements, and financial costs. Reducing the\nfinancial and computational burden of machine learning approaches is\nessential to increasing the equity of environmental monitoring processes\nand outputs. Our approach demonstrates a pipeline to make predictions on\nground-truth data using the Random Convolutional Features method through\na use case example of predicting crop yields in Zambia. These crop yield\npredictions can be used to analyze food security risk in the region. We\napply the novel machine learning approach, MOSAIKS (Rolf et al., 2021),\nto create tabular features for Zambia using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2\nsatellite imagery. We pair these generated features of Zambia with\nground-truth crop yield data to build a model that predicts crop yields\nover time and increases the spatial resolution of predicted crop yields.\nWe then use this model to fill in a data gap of crop yield predictions\nin Zambia during the years 2020 and 2021. During these years, crop yield\ndata was not collected due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving a gap in\nfood security forecasting. Beyond this use case, these tabular features\nof satellite imagery and the methodology developed to create them\nprovides a tool for others to build models and generate predictions of\nother social and environmental variables in this region.\nPlease see the GitHub organization here.\nPlease see the final project presententation here.\nPlease see this project’s poster for the Yale School of the\nEnvironment: New Horizons in Conservation Conference here.\nCollaborators:\nGrace Lewin\nSteven Cognac\nCullen Molitor\nMentorship: Thank you to Tamma Carleton from UC\nSanta Barbara and Jonathan Proctor from Harvard University. Your vision\nfor this project, existing codebase, and research expertise helped make\nthis project a reality.\n\n\n\nAnthropogenic\nniche partitioning: mesocarnivore spatial and temporal coexistence along\nan urban gradient\nABSTRACT\nWe\nunderstand little about how our urbanizing world influences temporal and\nspatial niche partitioning among synathropic mammals. My research\nobjectives include (1) to analyze how species shift temporal coexistence\nin response to varying degrees of urbanization, and (2) evaluate spatial\nniche partitioning by calculating relative mammalian diversity along an\nurban gradient. Urban species include the North American raccoon,\nstriped skunk, red fox, brush rabbit, and Virginia opossum. Nine camera\ntraps are deployed throughout three distinct habitats along an urban\ngradient. Urbanization positively correlates with nocturnality, and\nseasonality strongly predicts activity patterns that differ between\nspecies. Shifting activity patterns can disrupt delicate ecological\nrelationships and specialized resource exploitation.\nPoster presented at the UC Santa Barbara Undergraduate Research\nColloquium:\n\nFunding: This project was possible thanks to the\nUndergraduate Research and Creative Activities Grant from UC Santa\nBarbara.\nMentorship: Thank you to Molley Hardesty-Moore and\nDoug McCauley from UC Santa Barbara. Your mentorship and research\nexpertise helped make this project a reality.\nFiltration\nEfficiency in Bivalves: effects of species and size in oysters and\nmussels\nABSTRACT\nFilter-feeding\nbivalves possess the potential to naturally improve marine ecosystems\nsuffering from an overabundance of particulate organic matter and\nanthropogenic pollution through their water filtration processes.\nHowever, differences in realized potentials related to species identity\nand size are poorly understood. This project strives to (1) analyze\nfiltration rates as they correspond to species in Pteria\nsterna, Pinctada mazatlanica, and Semimytilus\nalgosus, and (2) determine the independent influence of soft tissue\nvolume on this phenomenon. I performed species-segregated filtration\ntrials and analyzed the filtration efficiency per unit volume of soft\ntissue. Pteria sterna filters the fastest when considering\nspecies identity, but Semimytilus algosus filters most\nefficiently when considering water filtered per unit volume of soft\ntissue. Species and size are interconnected and codetermine filtration\nefficiency; size is the dominant factor regarding filtration, but\nspecies identity strongly predicts size. Microscope analysis of algae\nand bryozoans abundance before and after filtration trials implies that\nspecies differ in the organic matter they primarily consume.\nFurthermore, filtration rate does not increase linearly with larger\ngroup sizes, providing implications of social facilitation among\nbivalves.\n\nFull\nResearch Paper\nFunding: This project was possible through the\nTropical Biology and Conservation program at UC Santa Barbara and the\nMonteverde Institute, as well as the UC Santa Barbara EAP Gaucho\nScholarship.\nMentorship: Thank you to Frank Joyce of the\nMonteverde Institute, Costa Rice. Your mentorship and research expertise\nhelped make this project a reality.\n\n\n\n",
