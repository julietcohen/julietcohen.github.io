I started collecting data while traversing mountaintops and\nsnorkeling inside aquaculture nets, I learned to clean data and enter it\ninto databases in ArcGIS, and today my passion lies in gleaning\nmeaningful observations from ecological and environmental data. I\nconnected with R, Python, SQL, and EML slowly over time. However, I\ndidn’t make this journey alone. I found mentors in academic advisers,\nfield crew leaders, and data scientists that provided the tools to help\nme grow as a data scientist.\n\nMy coworker at the Oahu Invasive Species\nCommittee laughing as the field crew makes our way down a ridgeline\nafter a hard day’s work bushwacking through the dense uluhe plants that\ncover the lower elevation ridges in the Ko’olau Mountains.\nUndergraduate\nResearch at UC Santa Barbara\nI earned a B.S. in Ecology and Evolution from UC Santa Barbara, and\nduring this time I served as a research technician in Dr. Doug McCauley’s\nlab in the department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine\nBiology. I worked closely with PhD candidate Molly Hardesty-Moore\non her research investigating raccoon spatial ecology in urban\nlandscapes. We trapped raccoons around Santa Barbara county and fitted\nthem with radio collars, then tracked them using VHF telemetry\ntechniques. Molly used this spatial data in conjunction with hair\nsamples from raccoons, foxes, skunks, and opossums to compare behavior\nand dietary trends in raccoons that live in urban versus rural habitats.\nWhile the study was primarily interested in luring raccoons into traps\novernight, we often caught other small carnivores and watched them\nperuse the landscape via camera traps throughout Santa Barbara\nCounty.\nSome of my proudest camera trap photos included black bears and\nbobcats at Sedgwick Reserve:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI completed two independent research projects in undergrad: one\ninvestigating spatial and temporal niche overlap among urban mammals,\nand one looking at water filtration rates among different bivalve\nspecies in Costa Rican mariculture systems. The latter turned into my\nfirst scientific paper, and I had the chance to present my research at a\nbiological research symposium in Monteverde, Costa Rica in 2018. (Check\nout these projects under the Research tab.)\n\nMeasuring the water displacement of\nindividual bivalves at the end of a field day with my colleague Erin,\nwho was relaxing on the boat after a day of snorkeling and data\ncollection for her own research.\n\nleft:\nMeasuring the turbidity of my various species-specific buckets at\nregular time intervals. I would dive into the mariculture nets each day\nto collect new bivalve species, run my secchi disk filtration trials\nwith algae and bryozoans in the buckets, then return the bivalves to\ntheir natural habitat at the end of the day.\nRight:\nOne of my bivlavle filtration trials a the off-shore mariculture site.\nThe different species of bilvalves in each filtered the algae and\nbryozoans at different rates, resulting in different levels of\nturbidity.\n\nAn arboreal snake spotted on a night walk\nthrough the tropical rainforest in Monteverde, Costa Rica\n\nA highly venemous eyelash palm pit viper\nin the tropical rainforest of Costa Rica\nThe Lizard Days\nMy first job post graduation was a seasonal field technician position\nsurveying for flat tailed-horned lizards in desert habitat just inland\nof San Diego and El Centro in Southern California. I committed to a\nthree month season working with a small crew composed of three other\nfemale field technicians for the Herpetology Department at the San Diego\nNatural History Museum. I surveyed through the hot, arid desert Monday\nthrough Friday, often working 50-hour weeks, and then returned to\nbeautiful Santa Barbara on the weekends to reunite with my friends and\npet gecko. These two-day vacations were often filled with indulging in\nthe luxuries of civilization such as washing machines. I would take\nextensive walks along the bluffs just to admire all the diverse plant\ncommunities because they were simply something different than the sea of\nsparse creosote bushes that surrounded me all week long.\n\nThe first flat-tailed horned lizard we\nspotted during day 1 of survey season\n\nThis iguana has a unique strategy to\navoid the hot desert floor.\nOur team’s mission was to systematically survey for flat-tailed\nhorned lizards to determine its range throughout the arid desert\nlandscape. This survey was the natural history museum’s attempt to prove\na that this land is critical habitat for a threatened species and in\nturn prevent geothermal mining in the region. We did indeed find plenty\nof spikey lizards, camouflaged side winder rattlesnakes, nighthawk\nnests, countless skeletons, beetles that play dead, kangaroo rat tracks,\nand ominous badger holes. The sunrises and sunsets really enhance the\nbeauty and solitude of the desert landscape, and I wouldn’t trade those\nfield days driving a truck through the sand for anything. I still think\nabout the flat-tailed horned lizards fairly often. I wonder how they’re\nholding up these days.\n\nThe flat-tiled horned lizard crew\nadmiring the first flat-tailed horned lized spotted that season sunning\nnext to a creosote bush.\nInvasive Species in Hawaii\nMy second seasonal field job was a field technician and data\nspecialist position at the Oahu\nInvasive Species Committee. I picked up my life and move to the town\nof Kaneohe on the island of Oahu and promptly bought a moped and a\nmosquito net. My work included surveying for incipient invasive plant\nand insect species in the lush forests of the Ko’olau mountains on the\neast side of the island of Oahu. I quickly fell in love with the extreme\nridgelines of the Ko’olau mountains, and I grew tough from the grueling\ndifficulty of the survey field work. Despite the danger of traversing\nperilous mountain ranges while bushwhacking through impossible tangles\nof invasive species like thick strawberry guava tree groves and spikey\nlantana, I loved my time serving the Oahu Invasive Species\nCommittee.\n\nDeep in a humid, mosquito-filled gulch, I\nspotted a juvenile Miconia calvescens plant and plucked it with\nenthusiasm.\nFor special operations each month, we also surveyed for plant species\nin the high elevation forests and in select regions of the other\nmountain range of the west side; the Wai’anae mountains.\n\nTaking a break from tedious plants\nsurveys to admire the the views of the west side of the island. In the\nupper elevations of the Wai’anae Mountains, we surveyed for the\nincipient invasive plant species Chromolaeana odorata\n\nLeft:\nAn aerial survey for Miconia calvescens in the Ko’olau\nMountains with my coworker Nick at the Oahu Invasive Species\nCommittee.\nRight:\nAscending a side of a mountian ridge in high-elevation native forest in\nthe Ko’olau Mountains, surveying for native o’hia trees infected with an\ninvasive fungal pathogen called Rapid O’hia Death.\nMy coworkers were at the root of my fondness towards my experience\nworking at the Oahu Invasive Species Committee. My field crew taught me\nabout the native flora and fauna on Oahu, the history of the island’s\npeople and geology, and how Hawaii’s ecology is currently changing. We\nsuffered through endless days bushwhacking and being eaten alive by\nmosquitos. We bonded by helping untangle each other from invasive plant\nmasses, struggling to get ArcGIS to cooperate after a long day in the\nrain, and involuntarily screaming in fear when Kahekili and Josh, our\nhelicopter pilots, took dive bombs on aerial surveys just to see how\nclose they could scrape along the top of the invasive albezia trees. the\nfield crew talked politics on our radios while on survey, usually\nsmelled moldy, and never missed an opportunity to chase each other\naround the baseyard with invasive Jackson’s chameleons we confiscated\nfrom the field. I miss the OISC crew more than any other part of my time\nin Hawaii.\n\nLeft:\nMy coworker Ryan and I admiring a waterfall near Waimanalo, Oahu in our\nMiconia calvescens survey uniforms\nRight:\nOur field crew for the day hiking in the lowland Ko’olau forest to reach\na remote transect destination area that was filled with mosquitos, mud,\nand tangled hao plant.\n\nLeft:\nMy coworkers Phill and Kepano and I discussing the day’s survey plan in\nthe middle of native uluhe (the plant species you see here) on a ridge\noh the east side of the island\nRight:\nTwo invasive Jackson’s chameleons we found on survey in low-elevation\nforest. As our job was to remove invasive species to prevent harm to\nnative Hawaiian flora and fauna, we confiscate these individuals from\nthe field because they prey upon native Hawaiian snails.\nSouthern California\nSteelhead Trout\nI served as a fisheries technician for the Pacific States Marine\nFisheries Commission and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife\nto survey for the endangered Southern California Steelhead Trout. We\nconducted surveys for the migratory fish themselves and their resident\ncounterparts, rainbow trout. We collected data on their abundance, size,\nand the environmental conditions of the freshwater streams in which they\nresided (temperature, gravel quailty, etc.). We also conducted redd\nsurveys, taking data on trout nests in the gravel bottoms of shallow\nfreshwater streams. We electric-fished certain streams to get a\ncomprehensive estimate of their population size and PIT tag larger\nindividuals to track their migration upstream during breeding season in\nDecember - April, and their return to the Pacific Ocean around\nApril-May.\n\nLeft:\nA redd survey in Gobernador Creek in Carpinteria, CA.\nRight: A redd\nsurvey in Matilija Creek in Ojai, CA.\n\nElectric fishing in Topanga Creek with\nthe goal of PIT tagging adult trout. We administer a mild shock into the\nwater with that large backpack pictured here, scoop the stunned fish\ninto buckets of oxygenated water, medicate the fish, insert a PIT tag,\nand release them back into the creek when they have fully\nrecovered.\nLeft:\nMeasuring a small trout we caught while electric fishing before\nreturning it to the creek.\nRight:\nWe often found two-striped garter snakes on survey in riparian habiat.\nThis snake species is not aggressive towards predators such as humans,\nbut rather predates on fish (like chub and trout), insects, and other\nsmaller prey.\nLastly, we utilized DIDSON\nunderwater sonar camera technology to film our freshwater streams\n24/7 to capture steelhead migrations. We deployed cameras in the Ventura\nRiver, Salispuedes Creek, and the Santa Ynez Rvier. These very high-tech\ncameras utilize sound waves to detect both biotic and abiotic movement\nin the water, and it was my job to detect trout and other species, such\nas native chub and invasive catfish, based on their sillouettes in the\ncamera footage.\n\nData entry: reviewing sonar footage of\nfish, debris, and the occassional water bird and freshwater turtle in\nsteelhead trout habitat\n\nThe DIDSON crew all geared up to snorkel\naround the Ventura River camera to find the invasive catfish species we\nrepeatedly saw during footage review\n\nA chunky alligator lizard sunning on a\nstone in steelhead trout habitat in Gobernador Creek in Ojai,\nCA\n\nA native western pond turtle in steelhead\ntrout habitat in Gaviota Creek, CA. We recorded measurements of these\nturtles as well as their gender and location to track their populations\nthroughout Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties.\n\n\n\n",

These field roles inspired me to delve into\n              environmental data science in order to recognize broad\n              ecological patterns across diverse scientific\n              disciplines.\n              Going forward, I aim to utilize modeling\n              techniques and spatial data\n              science to understand the population dynamics of\n              species that are most imperiled by urban expansion and\n              climate change. With open source programming tools and a\n              collaborative approach, I hope to advise preventative\n              policies to protect wildlife from anthropogenic\n              influence.\n              \n              \n              Arctic Data & Marine Science\n              I work at the National Center for Ecological\n              Analysis and Synthesis.

Many highly impacted regions\nlack the assets to monitor and generate resource predictions, and\ntherefore lack high-quality environmental and social data. As a result,\nit is difficult to make predictions about the impacts of climate change\nfor these regions using conventional modeling tools. Recently, machine\nlearning approaches applied to high-resolution satellite imagery have\nbeen successful in making predictions of a wide range of social and\nenvironmental variables. However, generating these predictions comes\nwith significant barriers, including high computational costs, data\nstorage and expertise requirements, and financial costs. Reducing the\nfinancial and computational burden of machine learning approaches is\nessential to increasing the equity of environmental monitoring processes\nand outputs. Our approach demonstrates a pipeline to make predictions on\nground-truth data using the Random Convolutional Features method through\na use case example of predicting crop yields in Zambia. These crop yield\npredictions can be used to analyze food security risk in the region. We\napply the novel machine learning approach, MOSAIKS (Rolf et al., 2021),\nto create tabular features for Zambia using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2\nsatellite imagery. We pair these generated features of Zambia with\nground-truth crop yield data to build a model that predicts crop yields\nover time and increases the spatial resolution of predicted crop yields.\nWe then use this model to fill in a data gap of crop yield predictions\nin Zambia during the years 2020 and 2021. During these years, crop yield\ndata was not collected due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving a gap in\nfood security forecasting. Beyond this use case, these tabular features\nof satellite imagery and the methodology developed to create them\nprovides a tool for others to build models and generate predictions of\nother social and environmental variables in this region.\nPlease see the\nGitHub organization here.\nCollaborators:\nGrace Lewin\nSteven Cognac\nCullen Molitor\nMentorship: Thank you to Tamma Carleton from UC\nSanta Barbara and Jonathan Proctor from Harvard University.

My research\nobjectives include (1) to analyze how species shift temporal coexistence\nin response to varying degrees of urbanization, and (2) evaluate spatial\nniche partitioning by calculating relative mammalian diversity along an\nurban gradient. Urban species include the North American raccoon,\nstriped skunk, red fox, brush rabbit, and Virginia opossum. Nine camera\ntraps are deployed throughout three distinct habitats along an urban\ngradient. Urbanization positively correlates with nocturnality, and\nseasonality strongly predicts activity patterns that differ between\nspecies. Shifting activity patterns can disrupt delicate ecological\nrelationships and specialized resource exploitation.\nPoster presented at the UC Santa Barbara Undergraduate Research\nColloquium:\n\nFunding: This project was possible thanks to the\nUndergraduate Research and Creative Activities Grant from UC Santa\nBarbara.\nMentorship: Thank you to Molley Hardesty-Moore and\nDoug McCauley from UC Santa Barbara. Your mentorship and research\nexpertise helped make this project a reality.\nFiltration\nEfficiency in Bivalves: effects of species and size in oysters and\nmussels\nABSTRACT\nFilter-feeding\nbivalves possess the potential to naturally improve marine ecosystems\nsuffering from an overabundance of particulate organic matter and\nanthropogenic pollution through their water filtration processes.\nHowever, differences in realized potentials related to species identity\nand size are poorly understood. This project strives to (1) analyze\nfiltration rates as they correspond to species in Pteria\nsterna, Pinctada mazatlanica, and Semimytilus\nalgosus, and (2) determine the independent influence of soft tissue\nvolume on this phenomenon. I performed species-segregated filtration\ntrials and analyzed the filtration efficiency per unit volume of soft\ntissue. Pteria sterna filters the fastest when considering\nspecies identity, but Semimytilus algosus filters most\nefficiently when considering water filtered per unit volume of soft\ntissue. Species and size are interconnected and codetermine filtration\nefficiency; size is the dominant factor regarding filtration, but\nspecies identity strongly predicts size. Microscope analysis of algae\nand bryozoans abundance before and after filtration trials implies that\nspecies differ in the organic matter they primarily consume.\nFurthermore, filtration rate does not increase linearly with larger\ngroup sizes, providing implications of social facilitation among\nbivalves.\n\nFull\nResearch Paper\nFunding: This project was possible through the\nTropical Biology and Conservation program at UC Santa Barbara and the\nMonteverde Institute, as well as the UC Santa Barbara EAP Gaucho\nScholarship.\nMentorship: Thank you to Frank Joyce of the\nMonteverde Institute, Costa Rice. Your mentorship and research expertise\nhelped make this project a reality.\n\n\n\n",
