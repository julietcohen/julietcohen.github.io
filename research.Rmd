## Anthropogenic niche partitioning: mesocarnivore spatial and temporal coexistence along an urban gradient

#### ABSTRACT

###### We understand little about how our urbanizing world influences temporal and spatial niche partitioning among synathropic mammals. My research objectives include (1) to analyze how species shift temporal coexistence in response to varying degrees of urbanization, and (2) evaluate spatial niche partitioning by calculating relative mammalian diversity along an urban gradient. Urban species include the North American raccoon, striped skunk, red fox, brush rabbit, and Virginia opossum. Nine camera traps are deployed throughout three distinct habitats along an urban gradient. Urbanization positively correlates with nocturnality, and seasonality strongly predicts activity patterns that differ between species. Shifting activity patterns can disrupt delicate ecological relationships and specialized resource exploitation.

## Filtration Efficiency in Bivalves: effects of species and size in oysters and mussels

#### ABSTRACT
###### Filter-feeding bivalves possess the potential to naturally improve marine ecosystems suffering from an overabundance of particulate organic matter and anthropogenic pollution through their water filtration processes. However, differences in realized potentials related to species identity and size are poorly understood. This project strives to (1) analyze filtration rates as they correspond to species in *Pteria sterna*, *Pinctada mazatlanica*, and *Semimytilus algosus*, and (2) determine the independent influence of soft tissue volume on this phenomenon. I performed species-segregated filtration trials and analyzed the filtration efficiency per unit volume of soft tissue. *Pteria sterna* filters the fastest when considering species identity, but *Semimytilus algosus* filters most efficiently when considering water filtered per unit volume of soft tissue. Species and size are interconnected and codetermine filtration efficiency; size is the dominant factor regarding filtration, but species identity strongly predicts size. Microscope analysis of algae and bryozoans abundance before and after filtration trials implies that species differ in the organic matter they primarily consume. Furthermore, filtration rate does not increase linearly with larger group sizes, providing implications of social facilitation among bivalves.
